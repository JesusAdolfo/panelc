				Star-Ledger, The (Newark, NJ)<br><br>
				July 4, 1999<br><br>
				Author: Cody Kendall, Edition: FINAL, Section: SPOTLIGHT, Page: 11, Article Text:<br><br>
				The food produced by executive chef John Simon offers a mixture of classic and New Age Italian, geared to snackers inclined toward pizza as well as big spenders looking for a hefty steak or veal chop.<br><br>
				The menu is dazzling without being overwhelming. You can rely on finding such standards as fried calamari ($8), bruschetta ($4.50) or osso bucco ($19), but then there are the surprises.<br><br>
				One is the delightfully sweet sfogi in saor ($8.50), a Venetian specialty - saut√©ed flounder topped with caramelized onions and golden raisins - such an unusual, exciting combination. Red wine vinegar introduces another note to this piece, while pine nuts add texture. Taken together, it's an unfamiliar taste, but quite compelling.
